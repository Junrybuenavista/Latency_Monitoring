The purpose of the website is to monitor the homebased teacher latency on the app server the they are using when they are having a class, because sometime the ISP is having a connection latency problem that is why I made this app is ever there is a teacher with a problem we can easily transfer her to class to other teacher with good connection.

Here I attached the full PHP and javascript code on the backend of the server and also the sql file that save the link and the teacher name.

I also put the JAVA code that send http on that server to update their ping time to time. this app is what I put to each computer of the teacher and put it to startup folder so that each time they turn ON the computer the app will run.
